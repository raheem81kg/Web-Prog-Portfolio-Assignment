                <br />
                <h3>Part A: "Twelve Pillars" Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    I have recently delved into Chapters 4 to 7 of "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, exploring pages 43
                    to 80. This insightful book has left a lasting impact on my personal development journey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In these chapters, the authors delve into essential principles for personal growth and success. They emphasize the
                    importance of taking responsibility for one's life, setting clear goals, and nurturing a strong work ethic. They
                    stress the value of continuous learning and the influence of the people we surround ourselves with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One key takeaway is the concept of personal responsibility. The idea that I am solely responsible for my own
                    success and happiness resonates deeply with me. It's a reminder that I have the power to shape my destiny through
                    my choices and actions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the notion of setting clear and compelling goals is crucial. By defining what I want to achieve, I
                    can create a roadmap for my life. This involves setting both short-term and long-term goals, which provide
                    direction and motivation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the importance of continuous learning and personal development is a theme that stands out. Education
                    doesn't end with formal schooling; it's a lifelong journey. I aim to embrace this principle by seeking
                    opportunities for learning and self-improvement in various aspects of my life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of application, I plan to integrate these principles into my daily routine. I will take full
                    responsibility for my choices and actions, continually refine my goals, and commit to ongoing learning. Moreover,
                    I'll be mindful of the people I surround myself with, understanding that they can influence my mindset and
                    aspirations.

                <h3>Part B: Academic Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    The degree I am diligently working towards is a Computer Science. Through my academic journey, I have honed several
                    valuable skills that I believe will serve me well in both my personal and professional life. The top three skills I
                    have acquired so far are:
                </p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span class="skill">Research and Critical Thinking:</span> Pursuing my degree has sharpened my ability to
                            conduct thorough research, analyze information critically, and draw evidence-based conclusions. This skill
                            is instrumental in making informed decisions and solving complex problems.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span class="skill">Effective Communication:</span> I have developed strong communication skills, both in
                            written and verbal forms. These skills have been nurtured through presentations, essays, and collaborative
                            projects. Effective communication is indispensable in conveying ideas, collaborating with peers, and
                            building meaningful relationships.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span class="skill">Time Management and Organization:</span> Balancing coursework, assignments, and other
                            commitments has taught me the art of time management and organization. These skills have not only helped me
                            excel academically but also maintain a balanced lifestyle, allowing me to pursue personal development and
                            extracurricular activities.
                        </p>
